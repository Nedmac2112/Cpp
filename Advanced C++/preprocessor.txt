"contents of the <iostream> library are copied into the cpp file"
using namespace std;

float a = 12.0f;
float b = 8.0f;
float c;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    c = (((3.14)+(b))/2); // Replacing AVG(PI, b) with (((3.14)+(b))/2) and PI with 3.14
    cout << c;
    return 0;
}

To include "FEET_TO_CM = 30.48" in all my C++ files, I would put "FEET_TO_CM = 30.48" in a header file (test.h for example).
I would then write "#include "test.h"" in the files where I want access to "FEET_TO_CM = 30.48".

test.h
#ifndef TEST_H
#define TEST_H

const double FEET_TO_CM = 30.48;

#endif

main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "test.h"
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << FEET_TO_CM; // 30.48 is ouput to the console
}
