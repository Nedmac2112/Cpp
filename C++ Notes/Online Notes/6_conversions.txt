Conversions in C++


auto: the auto keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of data being used
Ex. auto x = 7;
This auto value determines what value is stored in x, without you having to tell it
In this case, x is assigned the int data type
This is useful in more advanced programming, when you have complicated data types

Implicit conversions
Ex. int a = 6;
    double b = 7.5
    auto c = a * b; 
In this case, c will be have a data type of double
The reason it will not have an integer data type, is because whichever the bigger data type being used is,
that is what will be assigned to the new variable (double is 8 bytes, int is 4 bytes)

Explicit conversions

Old way (don't use this anymore)
Ex. double x = 4.5;
    auto y = (int)(x);

Modern way
Ex. double x = 22.5;
    double y = 2.75;
    auto z = static_cast<int>(x) + static_cast<int>(y); z equals 24 (22 + 2)
    You could also do it this way (will give a different answer in this case)
    auto z = static_cast<int>(x + y); z equals 25 (22.5 + 2.75 = 25.25 --> 25)
